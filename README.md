## Coding Rules

- use OOP and ES6
- camelCase all the way
- Only Object and Class names start with upper case letter
- private and local variable and functions start with underscore _myVar
- use 2 spaces for tabs

If your IDE supports is an .eslint and .editconfig file are included in the project

## Git flow

Development is done using git flow. Any new feature you build should be created on a feature branch so it can be merged into develop for testing. Production is deployed from master.

- start a new feature branch for each feature
- after you are done create a pull request to develop
- close your branch after it's merged
